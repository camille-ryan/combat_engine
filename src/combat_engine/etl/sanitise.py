"""Taking the prose out.

Game systems cannot be trademarked; the words they are printed in can. So
the engine holds mechanics and ids, and the names live only in a
localisation file built from whoever's copy of the compendium.

This module is the seam. Everything an authoring agent is shown passes
through it, and it does two jobs:

* **drop the flavour.** A power's page has a name in its `<h1>` and a line
  of italics under it. Both go. What is left is the lines that carry a
  mechanical label, which is exactly what needs coding.
* **scrub self-reference.** A stat block names itself in its own rules --
  "the target contracts <name> filth fever" -- and a power's name turns up
  inside its own Effect line often enough to matter. Those become the row's
  id, so the spec reads "contracts m145 filth fever" and the author learns
  nothing they should not have.
