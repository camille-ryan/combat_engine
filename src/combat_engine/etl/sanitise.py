"""Taking the prose out.

Game systems cannot be trademarked; the words they are printed in can. So
the engine holds mechanics and ids, and the names live only in a
localisation file built from whoever's copy of the compendium.

This module is the seam. Everything an authoring agent is shown passes
through it, and it does two jobs:

* **drop the flavour.** A power's page has a name in its `<h1>` and a line
  of italics under it. Both go. What is left is the lines that carry a
  mechanical label, which is exactly what needs coding.
* **scrub self-reference.** A stat block says "the target contracts dire rat
  filth fever", and a power's own name turns up inside its own Effect line
  often enough to matter. Those get replaced with the row's id, so the spec
  reads "contracts m145 filth fever" and the agent learns nothing it should
  not have.
